# Input data {.unnumbered}

For the test we will use:

-   TROLL 4.0
-   Global parameters from @schmitt2024
-   Species for Paracou from @schmitt2024
-   METRADICA soil maps
-   Climate data from ERA5-Land reanalysis [@mu√±oz-sabater2021]

The limits are:

-   The absence of soil depth variation and water table depth representation
-   The reduced species pool and functional space
-   The absence of calibration and tuning for mortality and crown radius allometry, which drive canopy packing, as well as the leaf-shedding parameters, which are important for TROLL4.0 dynamics
