# Input data {.unnumbered}

For the test we will use:

-   TROLL 4.0
-   Global parameters from @schmitt2024
-   Species for Paracou from @schmitt2024
-   METRADICA soil maps (I. Maréchaux pers. com.)
-   Climate data from ERA5-Land reanalysis [@muñoz-sabater2021]

The limits are:

-   The absence of soil depth variation (see METRADICA) and water table depth representation (see Bianca Ruis' postdoc)
-   The reduced species pool and functional space (see Guillaume Salzet's PhD)
-   The absence of calibration and tuning for mortality and crown radius allometry, which drive canopy packing, as well as the leaf-shedding parameters, which are important for TROLL4.0 dynamics (see @schmitt2024)
