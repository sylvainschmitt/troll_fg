This folder contains the data needed to run the virtual experiment with a snakemake workflow. They are produced in the analyses (specifically in the input data chapter). In particular they include:

-   `correspondence_era.tsv`: the correspondence table between the grid of our simulations and the grid of ERA5-Land
-   `era.tsv`: ERA5-Land data
-   `grid_era.tsv`: the grid of our simulations after removing cells without information in ERA5-Land
-   `soil.tsv`: soil data from METRADICA prepared for TROLL 4.0
-   `species.tsv`: species data prepared for TROLL 4.0
