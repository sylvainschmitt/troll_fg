The general idea is to test TROLL 4.0's ability to simulate the regional pattern of carbon balance (first test with gross primary production (GPP)) in French Guiana [@maréchaux2024; @schmitt2024]. We will evaluate the spatial projections produced against regional patterns of forest structure derived from remote sensing, as well as point-wise forest inventories for forest dynamics and diversity, and single-point fluxes from an eddy tower. Further work could then explore the effect of future climates on the carbon balance.

## Usage

**troll_fg** analyses rely on the quarto documents (`files.qmd`) that can be run with R and associated environment defined with [renv](#0).

## Project

**troll_tee** includes:

-   Analyse of the data with associated documentation and figures:
    -   Reproductive analyses in `files.qmd`
    -   Resulting pages in `docs/`
    -   Document structure definition in `_quarto.yml`
-   All data in `data/`
-   `simulations/` contain the snakemake and singularity workflow to run all simulations.
-   Intermediary files in `outputs/`
-   Figures in `figures/`
-   R environment definition with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) in `renv/` and `renv/lock`
-   R files (`.Rbuildignore` , `.Rdata` , `.Rprofile` , `.Rhistory`)
-   Git and GitHub files (`.gitignore` , `.github/`)
-   Project documentation (`README.qmd` , `README.md` , `NEWS.md` , `LICENSE`)
