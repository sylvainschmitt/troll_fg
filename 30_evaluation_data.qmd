# Evaluation data {.unnumbered}

We are going to use three types of data for evaluating different simulations outputs:

-   Simulated forest fluxes will be evaluated against a single point - Guyaflux [@bonal2008] - as in @schmitt2024
-   Simulated forest dynamics and composition will be evaluated against several study areas with several censuses from the Guyafor network (<https://paracou.cirad.fr/website/experimental-design/guyafor-network>)
-   Simulated spatial forest structure will be evaluated against multiple remote sensing product (e.g. Height with GEDI, ELVIS, or @lahssini2024, @wagner2025; GPP with SIF, LAI with MODIS, Biomass with @fayad2016 or @santoro2025; ...)
