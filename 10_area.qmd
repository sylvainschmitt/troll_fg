# Study area {.unnumbered}

Based on the JRC's Tropical Moist Forest product [@bourgoin2024], we decided to work at the scale of French Guiana, focusing on undisturbed forests. We used @fayad2016 's biomass map to investigate the required resolution for modelling biomass spatially. We decided to use a 10 km grid, first testing on a total area of 0.1Â°, corresponding to 100 simulations. The resulting variation in biomass within grid cells was low, with a median of 13.5 Mg/ha.
